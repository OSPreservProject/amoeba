Note that we no longer support the FLIP driver in Ultrix or Irix.
It may well be possible to build it into these kernels but we
do not have the resources to do it.  The notes in the manuals are
from several versions ago for both Ultrix and Amoeba and may bear
no relationship to current reality.

We apologise for the inconvenience.
