--------------------------------------------

This directory contains the compressed tar file of the Amoeba source code.
The uncompressed SRC.tar is about 20.55 MB.

It also contains a script to upgrade an Amoeba 5.2 directory graph to
an Amoeba 5.3 directory graph.  This is in upgrade.tar (approx 8 KB).

Notes:

1.  SRC.tar.Z does not contain the src changes needed to build X11R6.
    These will be provided later.

2.  If you are having trouble FTPing big files due to flakey network
    connections there is a split version of SRC.tar.Z available.
    INSTEAD of FTPing SRC.tar.Z you can FTP Split_src/SRC.Z.* and
    reconnect them later with:
	cat SRC.Z.* | uncompress > SRC.tar

3.  If you already have a version of the Amoeba sources do NOT dump the new
    sources over the top of the old version.  Some files have been moved or
    deleted and so you will get an inconsistent source tree.  Therefore move
    the old sources somewhere else or delete them.

Untarring:
    Under UNIX:
	SRC.tar should be untarred at the top level of the Amoeba tree.
    Under Amoeba:
	SRC.tar should be untarred under /super/module/amoeba.
    (To untar it under Amoeba you will need a UNIX machine running the
    flip-driver and commands like

	W=/super/module/amoeba
	zcat SRC.tar.Z | ax -E _WORK= -C WORK= /bin/tar xvf -

    will untar it into the directory /super/module/amoeba for you.)

Patches:
    There are currently 2 patches available for Amoeba.

    patch1.tar - fixes a bug in aps and a bug in newsoapgraph
    patch2.tar - fixes a bug in ftpd and another bug in newsoapgraph
