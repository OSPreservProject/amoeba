    README Files
    ************
There is a README file in each directory which explains what each file
is and gives a checksum (see sum(1) under UNIX) for checking that it
was correctly FTPed.  Read the README files in the subdirectories to
avoid ftping unnecessary files!!  The large tar files are also split
into lots of smaller files and you don't need to take the split version
if you take the complete version.

    Frequently Asked Questions
    **************************
Also read the FAQ file (frequently asked questions) in this directory.
It explains the RTFM system which you need to know about.

    What you need to FTP
    ********************
You need the things from the generic directories (unix, src, doc).  The
binaries for each machine type, including X and MMDF binaries are in
sun4, sun3 and ibm_at respectively.  Finally there is other third-party
software which is not part of Amoeba but which has been tried on Amoeba
and seems to work.  This is in the directory "thirdp" and is only
provided in source form.  You must compile it yourself.  If you want to
compile your Amoeba system with the GNU C compiler you will need some
configuration files from the directory thirdp.

Updates may be made available from time to time in the form of source code
patches.  Therefore it is a good idea to learn how to build your own
configurations and kernels.
