This directory contains various items of third party software.
They are provided "as is".  They probably work but we make no
promises.  The various programs may have restrictions on
commercial use and/or redistribution.  Do not use anything you
are no legally entitled to, lest you be prosecuted by the owners
of the software.

All files are tar format.  The sizes given below are of the
uncompressed tar file.

The following are third-party *sources* and should be untarred in
`amdir`/thirdp

  Name		 Size	    Description
tcsh-6.04.tar    1.8 MB The sources for tcsh with support for Amoeba.
			Note that command typeahead is flushed - rather
			irritating.
mawk             750 KB	A clone of awk.  You need mawk to build the sparc
			port under Amoeba.  Bawk isn't good enough.

			Amoeba.  (The binaries, etc are already in the main
			distribution)
